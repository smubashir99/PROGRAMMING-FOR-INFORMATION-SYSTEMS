# Fetch API Using Promises

## Description
This project demonstrates how to use JavaScript Promises with the Fetch API.
The example was created after understanding the lecture on creating and using promises.

## What is implemented
- Creating a Promise using the Promise constructor
- Fetching data from an API
- Resolving the promise when data is received
- Rejecting the promise when an error occurs
- Handling success using then()
- Handling errors using catch()

## How it works
When the button is clicked, a function is called which fetches user data from an API.
The fetch call is wrapped inside a Promise.
If the API request is successful, the promise is resolved and data is displayed on the page.
If an error occurs, the promise is rejected and handled using catch().

## Technologies Used
